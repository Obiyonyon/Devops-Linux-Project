# File Backup and Timestamping

This script defines the source directory and backup directory paths. It then creates a timestamp using the current date and time, and creates a backup directory with the timestamp appended to its name. Then copies all files from the source directory to backup directory using the cp command with the -r option for recursive copying. Finally, it displays a message indicating the completion of the backup process and shows the path of the backup directory with the timestamp.
